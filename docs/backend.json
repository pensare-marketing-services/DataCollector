    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to address the requirements for the GatherWise application, focusing on data collection, user information storage, and future dashboard filtering capabilities. It leverages path-based ownership and segregation of data to ensure secure and efficient data access. Given the application's need to collect user data and potentially implement a dashboard with filtering, the following structure is proposed:\n\n1.  **User Data Storage**: User data will be stored under a collection named `gatherwise_users`. Each document in this collection will represent a user's submission.\n\n2.  **Authorization Independence**:  Since there are no role-based authorization requirements specified and access is primarily based on individual user submissions, direct path-based ownership is most appropriate. No denormalization is needed as there's no collaborative aspect or shared data access.\n\n3.  **QAPs (Querying, Authorization, Predictability, Scalability)**: The structure supports required QAPs:\n    *   **Querying**: The design will allow for efficient filtering on `name`, `age`, `mandalam`, `mekhala`, and `unit` as requested for future dashboard implementation using Firestore's indexing capabilities.\n    *   **Authorization**: Security rules can be straightforward since access is based on individual document ownership (if further access controls are needed).\n    *   **Predictability**: The schema enforces a consistent structure for all user data submissions.\n\n4.  **Dashboard Filters**: The app requirements dictate filters based on `name`, `age`, `mandalam`, `mekhala`, and `unit` attributes. Given that, the structure will allow for compound queries on these fields."
